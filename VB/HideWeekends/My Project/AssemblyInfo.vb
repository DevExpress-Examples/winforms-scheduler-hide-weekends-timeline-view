' How to hide weekends in the Timeline view
' 
' This example illustrates the use of a custom scale to hide the weekends in the
' Timeline view. The Saturday and Sunday are considered weekend. The Friday column
' actually contains three days - Friday, Saturday and Sunday. So it is painted
' with the color specified for the non-working days. To correct this, the
' CustomDrawTimeCell event can be handled and the time cell can be painted
' manually. The Paint Correction check box is used for switching the event
' handling on and off.
